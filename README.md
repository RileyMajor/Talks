## Abstracts

### Correlated Concatenation

Since SQL Server 2005, a popular method for concatenating values across multiple rows has been to use the built-in XML functions. Of course they work well for the simple case involving a single field, but with one small trick, they can be used to make multiple, correlated lists based on different fields.

### Pseudo-Constants

You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.

### Open Up the Clubhouse

Boys, there's something important we need to talk about. Girls don't have cooties. It's time to take down the "No Gurlz Allowed" sign. This clubhouse is big enough for all of us, and we'll all have a better time if we learn to play nicely together.

The percentage of women in technology has fallen steadily since the early 80s. 92% of Stack Overflow survey respondents identified as a male. Girls are discouraged from technology at a young age, and those who make it through are often driven out by an unwelcoming technical community. There are the obvious examples of sickening death threats against those in the gaming industry, but the daily grind of subtle undermining of women's competencies also takes its toll.

Teams perform better with diverse viewpoints, so it's in all of our best interests to solve this problem. And of course it's just the right thing to do.

We'll explore some of the challenges women face in technology communities, review ways we can all help improve our environment, and discuss efforts to bring more women into technology led by groups like Girl Develop It.

## Bio

Riley Major is an Enterprise Architect at Manna Freight Systems, Inc., of Mendota Heights, MN. He’s been in the trenches with SQL Server for 14 years, focusing mostly on development and architecture. Riley cut his teeth on SQL Server 7, but has been on a syntactical sugar high since SQL Server 2005. He’s written or architected over a half million lines of SQL still in active use. Riley is particularly grateful that technology has saved him from having to use his law degree.
