## Abstracts

### Correlated Concatenation

Since SQL Server 2005, a popular method for concatenating values across multiple rows has been to use the built-in XML functions. Of course they work well for the simple case involving a single field, but with one small trick, they can be used to make multiple, correlated lists based on different fields.

### Pseudo-Constants

You know you’ve done it. Maybe it was the lucky number 7. Maybe it was an enigmatic X. Maybe you smooshed some words together in ALLCAPS. That should be easier to spot, right? Because some day you might need to change it—in every stored procedure, function, and view.

Magic numbers, codes, identifiers, constants, enumerations. Whatever you call them, all applications have them. Sure it’s quick and easy to sprinkle the values throughout your code, but that breeds mistakes, rigidity, and obfuscation. There has to be a better way!

Other languages give us real constants and enums—with IntelliSense and compilation-level enforcement. Well guess what-- SQL Server does too, sort of. Join us and learn to write clearer, easier to maintain code without sacrificing performance.

## Bio

 Riley Major is an Enterprise Architect at Manna Freight Systems, Inc., of Mendota Heights, MN. He’s been in the trenches with SQL Server for 14 years, focusing mostly on development and architecture. Riley cut his teeth on SQL Server 7, but has been on a syntactical sugar high since SQL Server 2005. He’s written or architected over a half million lines of SQL still in active use. Riley is particularly grateful that technology has saved him from having to use his law degree.
